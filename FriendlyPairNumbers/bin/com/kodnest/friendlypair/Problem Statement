Friendly Pair Numbers Identifications

You are assigned the task of developing a Java program that determines whether two given numbers are friendly pair numbers or not. 
Write a Java program that takes two integers as input and checks whether they form a friendly pair or not. Friendly pair numbers are a pair of integers (a, b) such that the sum of proper divisors of

'a' is equal to 'b' and the sum of proper divisors of 'b' is equal to 'a'.

Description:

Friendly pair numbers (also known as amicable or friendly numbers) are two distinct numbers that share a special relationship.
The sum of proper divisors (Factors excluding the number itself) of each number is equal to the other number. For example, the pair (220, 284) is a friendly pair because the sum of proper divisors of 220 is 284, and the sum of proper divisors of 284 is 220.
