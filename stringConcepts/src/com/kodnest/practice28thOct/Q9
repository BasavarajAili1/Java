Replace Spaces with "99" in Java

Imagine you are working on a text processing task, and you need to replace all the spaces in a 
given string with the characters "99." Your task is to create a Java program that takes a string 
as input, replaces all spaces with "99," and provides the modified string as output.

To illustrate this problem, consider the following scenario:

Suppose you are developing a chat application that encodes spaces in messages to ensure they are 
transmitted correctly over a network. You need to replace spaces with a specific character 
sequence, "99," for this purpose.

Test Case : 1
Input : Java programming is fun.

Output : Java99programming99is99fun.

Test Case : 2
Input : Hello, world!

Output : Hello,99world!
