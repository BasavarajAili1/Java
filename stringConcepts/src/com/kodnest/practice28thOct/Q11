Reverse Words at Their Own Position in Java

Imagine you are working on a text processing task, and you need to reverse the order of words in 
a given string while keeping the words themselves unchanged. Your task is to create a Java program 
that takes a string as input, reverses the order of words in the string, and provides the modified 
string as output.

To illustrate this problem, consider the following scenario:

Suppose you are developing a language translation tool, and you want to reverse the order of words 
in a sentence to create grammatically correct translations.

Test Case : 1
Input: This is a test
