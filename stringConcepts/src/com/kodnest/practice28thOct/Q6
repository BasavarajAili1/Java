Reverse a String in Java

Imagine you are working on a text processing application where you need to reverse a given string. 
This is a common task in many programming scenarios, such as when processing user input or manipulating text data. 
Your task is to create a Java program that takes a string as input, reverses it, and provides the reversed string as output.

To illustrate this problem, consider the following scenario:

Suppose you are developing a text editor, and users want to reverse the order of 
characters in a sentence for various reasons, such as for fun or to examine the 
text in a different way. Your program should allow users to input a sentence, 
and it should return the sentence with its characters reversed.
