Capitalize the First Letter of Each Word In a Sentence in Java

Imagine you are developing a text Formatting tool as part of a word processing application. 
Your task is to create a Java program that capitalizes the first letter of each word in all sentence. 
This program will be useful for users who want to convert text into title case.

Consider a scenario where a user is writing an article or a blog post and wants to ensure that the headings
and titles are in title case for a more professional appearance. Your program will automate this task for them.

Your task is to write a Java program that takes a sentence as input and capitalizes the First letter of each word in that sentence.
