Check Palindromic String in Java

Imagine you are developing a text analysis tool that needs to check if a given 
string is a palindrome. Palindromes are strings that read the same forwards and 
backwards, like "radar" or "madam." Your task is to create a Java program that 
takes a string as input, checks if it is a palindrome, and provides a result 
indicating whether the string is a palindrome or not.

To illustrate this problem, consider the following scenario:

Suppose you are building a word game where players need to guess palindromic words.
 Your program should allow players to input a word, and it should inform them 
 whether the word they entered is a palindrome.
 
Test Case : 1
Input: radar
output : The input string is a palindrome.

Test Case : 1
Input: java
output :
The input string is not a palindrome.
