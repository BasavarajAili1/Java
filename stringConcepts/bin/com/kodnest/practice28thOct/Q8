Remove Duplicate Characters from String in Java

Imagine you are building a text processing tool that requires removing duplicate 
characters from a given string. Your task is to create a Java program that takes 
a string as input, removes duplicate characters from it, and provides the 
resulting string without duplicates.

To illustrate this problem, consider the following scenario:

Suppose you are developing a program that analyzes text input from users and 
needs to process the input by removing any duplicate characters to make the 
analysis more efficient.

Test Case : 1
Input: hello
Output : helo
