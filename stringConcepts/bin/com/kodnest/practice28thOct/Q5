Generate and Display All Substrings in Java

Imagine you are working on a text analysis task, and you need to generate 
and display all possible substrings of a given string. Your task is to create 
a Java program that takes a string as input, generates all substrings, and provides them as output.

To illustrate this problem, consider the following scenario:

Suppose you are developing a search engine that needs to index all possible 
substrings of web page content. You need a program to generate these substrings 
efficiently.

Test Case : 1
Input: abc
Output:
a
ab
abc
b
bc
c

Input: java
Output:
j
ja
jav
java
a
av
ava
v
va
a

Question Elaborated Explanation:

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. For a given string of length n, there are n(n+1)/2 substrings. Your task is to display all these substrings.
